Please consult the file INSTALL in this directory for

The oomph-lib homepage

provides much more detail on installation instructions, tutorials, 
and licencing information. Provided you have downloaded a
distribution that contains the documentation and you have 
the required tools (mainly doxygen; get it from http://www.doxygen.org)
available on your machine, the installation procedure
will create a local copy of the oomph-lib webpages
and the entire online documentation in the doc directory.
In particular, doc/html/index.html is a local copy of the
