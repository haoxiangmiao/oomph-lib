In this document we demonstrate how to generate quadrilateral {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} meshes, based on the output from Barry Joe\textquotesingle{}s mesh generator \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geompack++}, } available as freeware at \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\tt http\+://members.\+shaw.\+ca/bjoe/.} The mesh generation is performed in a two-\/stage process. First we use \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geompack++} } to generate the mesh \char`\"{}offline\char`\"{}. Then we process the output files generated by \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geompack++} } to generate an {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} mesh.



 

\hypertarget{index_geompack_use}{}\section{Example of the use of Geompack++}\label{index_geompack_use}
The documents {\ttfamily meshoper.\+pdf} and {\ttfamily regmesh.\+pdf} distributed with \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geompack++} } contain a comprehensive User\textquotesingle{}s Guide for the code and its many options. \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geompack++} } is a very sophisticated mesh generator and can be used to create 2D and 3D meshes with a wide variety of element types. Here we only discuss how to use \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geompack++} } to generate 2D quadrilateral meshes. \mbox{[}The development of of {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} meshes that process \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geompack++\textquotesingle{}s} } output for other element types should be straightforward but is still on our \char`\"{}\+To Do\char`\"{} list -- any volunteers?\mbox{]}

\href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geompack++} } creates quadrilateral meshes, based on the information about the mesh boundaries (nodes and curves) provided in two input files, {\ttfamily filename.\+rg2} and {\ttfamily filename.\+cs2}, say. An output file, {\ttfamily filename.\+1.\+mh2} is created. It contains the information about the mesh boundaries, the nodal positions and the element connectivity lists.



\hypertarget{index_geomview}{}\subsection{How to visualise a mesh generated by Geompack++}\label{index_geomview}
To visualise the mesh, the program {\ttfamily Geomview} is available. ({\ttfamily Geomview} can be downloaded from the \href{http://www.geomview.org/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geomview} home page }.) The \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geompack++} } output file cannot be processed directly by \href{http://www.geomview.org/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geomview} } but a simple program that converts the file {\ttfamily filename.\+mh2} to a format that is readable by \href{http://www.geomview.org/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geomview} } is \href{../../../../demo_drivers/meshing/mesh_from_geompack/convert_geom_file.cc}{\tt available.}



\hypertarget{index_example}{}\subsection{The example\+: A rectangle with a hole}\label{index_example}
As an example we demonstrate how to use \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geompack++} } to generate a mesh for the rectangular domain with a hole shown in the figure below. The domain is defined by eight nodes and eight curves (straight lines) which connect the nodes and define two boundaries. The boundary numbers shown in the sketch correspond to those in the \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geompack++} } input region file \href{../../../../demo_drivers/meshing/mesh_from_geompack/box_hole.rg2}{\tt box\+\_\+hole.\+rg2 } and in the curve input file \href{../../../../demo_drivers/meshing/mesh_from_geompack/box_hole.cs2}{\tt box\+\_\+hole.\+cs2.} In the corresponding {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} mesh, the boundaries are numbered from zero.

 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{box_hole_2}
\doxyfigcaption{A rectangular domain with a hole. }
\end{DoxyImage}


The desired mesh characteristics are defined in the file \href{../../../../demo_drivers/meshing/mesh_from_geompack/box_hole.m2}{\tt box\+\_\+hole.\+m2} which specifies that the final mesh should contain approximately 200 elements. When processed with the command 
\begin{DoxyCode}
./geompack++ box\_hole.m2 error.log
\end{DoxyCode}
 \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geompack++ }} creates the output file \href{../../../../demo_drivers/meshing/mesh_from_geompack/box_hole.mh2}{\tt box\+\_\+hole.\+mh2.}

Here is a sketch of the resulting discretisation, as displayed by {\ttfamily geomview} \+:

\hypertarget{index_oomph_use}{}\section{Creating an oomph-\/lib mesh based on output files generated by Geompack++}\label{index_oomph_use}
{\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} provides a mesh, {\ttfamily Geompack\+Quad\+Mesh}, that uses the output from \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geompack++} } to generate an {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} Mesh containing {\ttfamily Q\+Element$<$2,2$>$} four-\/node quadrilateral elements. The relevant interface is\+:

The driver code \href{../../../../demo_drivers/meshing/mesh_from_geompack/mesh_from_geompack_poisson.cc}{\tt mesh\+\_\+from\+\_\+geompack\+\_\+poisson.\+cc} demonstrates the use of this mesh for the solution of a 2D Poisson problem in the \char`\"{}rectangular domain with a hole\char`\"{}, described in the previous section.

The code expects the names of {\ttfamily $\ast$}.{\ttfamily mh2} and $\ast$.{\ttfamily cs2} files generated by \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\tt {\ttfamily Geompack++} } as command line arguments and stores them in the namespace {\ttfamily Command\+Line\+Args}

  \}

The names of these files are then passed to the mesh constructor. Since the rest of the \href{../../../../demo_drivers/meshing/mesh_from_geompack/mesh_from_geompack_poisson.cc}{\tt driver code } is identical to that in the \href{../../../../doc/poisson/two_d_poisson/html/index.html}{\tt corresponding example with a structured mesh}, we do not provide a detailed code listing but simply show the plot of the computed results, together with the tanh-\/shaped exact solution of the problem\+:
