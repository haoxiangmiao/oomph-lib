\subsection*{Classes}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
class \hyperlink{classoomph_1_1LinearSolver}{oomph\+::\+Linear\+Solver}
\item 
class \hyperlink{classoomph_1_1DenseLU}{oomph\+::\+Dense\+LU}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Dense LU decomposition-\/based solve of full assembled linear system. V\+E\+RY inefficient but useful to illustrate the principle. Only suitable for use with Serial matrices and vectors. This solver will only work with non-\/distributed matrices and vectors (note\+: \hyperlink{classoomph_1_1DenseDoubleMatrix}{Dense\+Double\+Matrix} is not distributable) \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \hyperlink{classoomph_1_1FD__LU}{oomph\+::\+F\+D\+\_\+\+LU}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Dense LU decomposition-\/based solve of linear system assembled via finite differencing of the residuals \hyperlink{classoomph_1_1Vector}{Vector}. Even more inefficient than \hyperlink{classoomph_1_1DenseLU}{Dense\+LU} but excellent sanity check! \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \hyperlink{classoomph_1_1SuperLUSolver}{oomph\+::\+Super\+L\+U\+Solver}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em . Super\+LU Project Solver class. This is a combined wrapper for both Super\+LU and Super\+LU Dist. See \href{http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/}{\tt http\+://crd.\+lbl.\+gov/$\sim$xiaoye/\+Super\+L\+U/} Default Behaviour\+: If this solver is distributed over more than one processor then Super\+LU Dist is used. Member data naming convention\+: member data associated with the Super\+LU Dist solver begins Dist\+\_\+... and member data associated with the serial Super\+LU solver begins Serial\+\_\+... . \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
