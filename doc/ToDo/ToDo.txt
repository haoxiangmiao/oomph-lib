\mainpage The To-Do list

\section first Features/capabilities to be implemented and fully documented for the first "official" release:

- Finalise/document 2D/3D free-surface Navier-Stokes
- Finalise/document shell elements. 
- Eigenvalue problems and bifurcation tracking.
- Adaptive load balancing for distributed problems. 
.
\b Note: Most of this functionality is already available in the current 
distribution but no documentation has been written as yet.
