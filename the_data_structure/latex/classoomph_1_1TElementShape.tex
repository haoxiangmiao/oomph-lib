\subsubsection*{template$<$unsigned D\+IM, unsigned N\+N\+O\+D\+E\+\_\+1D$>$\newline
class oomph\+::\+T\+Element\+Shape$<$ D\+I\+M, N\+N\+O\+D\+E\+\_\+1\+D $>$}

A class for those member functions that must be fully specialised for the Telements. The fact that member functions of partially specialised classes cannot necessarily be fully specialised means that we must either fully specialise every class, or use this base class to fully specialize only those functions that are required.
